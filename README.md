# Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)

This repository contains the source code for Automatic Number Plate Recognition on photos. This solution is done as a part for an assignment on the course Methods and Applications of Artificial Intelligence on the Faculty of Electrical Engineering Sarajevo.

The topic of this project is the recognition of vehicle registration plates from pictures. This topic was chosen due to the needs of technical inspection stations for vehicles in Bosnia and Hercegovina and beyond. By recognizing vehicle license plates, vehicle data could be automatically retrieved which brings higher security standards to systems that use this detection.

Command to start the number plate recognition:
- python detection.py
